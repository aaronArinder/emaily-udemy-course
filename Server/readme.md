This is a project from a Udemy course by Stephen Grider on react, redux, node, express, mongoDB, and mongoose. The app is hosted at: https://salty-stream-83043.herokuapp.com/. Two major things (and a few minor things) need to be sorted out. First, the production environment's webhook doesn't work because sendgrid only allows for one; so, clicking 'yes' or 'no' in an email doesn't update the database or the app. Second, the dashboard needs to be overhauled for better navigation, ability to control how a user's surveys are shown, and the ability to delete surveys.
